        The H8D Utility is a program with the purpose of managing disk images in
        the H8D format. This is the format used for the Heathkit 8-bit computers
        such as the H8 and H89. On this web site are several
        <a href="../../software.html">hundred disk images</a> for the Heathkit
        8-bit computers.<br />
        <br />
        The utility includes the following functionality:<br /> </span

        To use the utility for generating a catalog of the contents of all your
        disk images, follow these steps:<br />
        <br />
        Click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">FOLDER</span> button and
        select a folder where your disk images reside. A list of disk images
        will be shown on the left side panel.<br />

          alt=""
        /><br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Now select one or more disk images on the left side window and click the
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">CATALOG</span> button.<br />
        <br />

        /><br />
        <br />
        <br />
        To generate a list of files from all of your disk images just leave them
        all unselected when you click the
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">CATALOG</span> button.<br />
        <br />

        ><br />
        With the disk contents listed on the right side you can scroll through
        the list, view any of the text files and extract any of the files to
        your PC hard disk. Just select the file on the right side and click the
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">VIEW</span> or
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXTRACT</span> button. When you extract
        a file it is stored in a folder with the name of the disk image file and
        "_Files" appended to it. To extract all the files from all the disk
        images just leave the files on the right side unselected when you press
        the <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXTRACT</span> button.<br />

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">SAVE TO TEXT</span>
        or <span style="font-weight: bold;">SAVE TO HTML</span> buttons. A file
        will be generated with the contents of the right side panel and saved to
        your hard disk. The file will be in the disk image folder you selected
        on the left side (where the images are) with the name
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">H8DCATALOG.TXT</span> or
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">H8DCATALOG.HTML</span>.<br />

        The H8D Utility also allows you to create H8D disk images. This is done
        using Dwight Elvey's fantastic H89LDR program. The H8D Utility has many
        of the H89LDR control program features built in. To use this feature
        follow these steps.<br />
        <br />
        First, load the H8D Utility and press the CREATE button.<br />
        <br />
        <img
          src="H8DUtility/Image1_8.jpg"
          style="width: 900px; height: 679px;"
          alt=""
        /><br />
        <br />
        The H89LDR program works by connecting your PC computer to your H8 or
        H89 via a serial cable link. When you press the
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">CREATE</span> button you will be
        presented with this screen where you can configure the COM port to use
        for communicating with the Heathkit computer.<br />
        <br />
        The next step is to press the
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Client Status</span> button.<br />
        <br />
        <img
          src="H8DUtility/Image1_9.jpg"
          style="width: 900px; height: 679px;"
          alt=""
        /><br />
        <br />
        At first you will see the above screen. No communications has been
        established yet between your PC and the Heathkit computer. Now you
        should follow Dwight's
        <a href="H8DUtility/README.TXT" target="_blank">README</a> file and key
        in one of the following bootstrap programs:<br />
        <br />
        <a href="H8DUtility/BOOTSTRP.TXT" target="_blank">H8 with H8-4 or H89</a
        ><br />
        <br />
        <a href="H8DUtility/BOTSTRP8.TXT" target="_blank"
          >H8 with H8-5 Cassette I/O board</a
        ><br />
        <br />
        Once the bootstrap program is entered and it is running on the Heathkit
        computer you can press the
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">SAVE</span> button to transmit the
        H89LDR client software. At this point the client software is running on
        the Heathkit computer and if everything went well you should see a
        "Client is ready" message in the log window. The H8D Utility will then
        ask if you wish to save the H89LDR program on the Heathkit computer to a
        disk so that you can boot directly to the loader client. Make sure you
        have a formatted disk in the Heathkit computer SY0 disk drive and select
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">YES</span> to create the boot disk or
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">NO</span> to skip this step.<br />
        <br />
        Once communications has been established between the Heathkit computer
        and your PC you can then click
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">RECEIVE</span> to copy a disk from your
        Heathkit computer to your PC or
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">SEND</span> to copy a disk from your PC
        to your Heathkit computer. Keep in mind that if you click
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">SEND</span>, once you select an image
        file and answer <span style="font-weight: bold;">YES</span> to start the
        process it will overwrite whatever disk is in your Heathkit computer so
        make sure you have a blank or unimportant disk in the SY0 drive.<br />

        The H8D Utility has a built-in H-89 emulator so that you can try any of
        the H8D disk images. The following operating systems are supported with
        the current version of the emulator:<br />

        HDOS 1.6<br />
        HDOS 2.0<br />

        <br />
        The H-89 emulator control panel will pop up.<br />

          src="H8DUtility/Emulator8.jpg"
        /><br />
        <br />
        From the control panel you can load H8D disk images into any of the
        drive slots by clicking the drive slot button (<span
          style="font-weight: bold;"
          >SY0</span
        >
        thru <span style="font-weight: bold;">SY2</span>). You can also select a
        system ROM and output terminal to emulate. Note that the output terminal
        is simulated, not emulated. By that I mean that it does not actually use
        the terminal ROM (although it does use the terminal FONT).
        It&nbsp;simply translates the ESC sequences for any special cursor
        functions or graphic characters and displays them accordingly. Most of
        the time you'll use the defaults which are the
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">444-62 (MTR-89)</span> system
        ROM and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">H-19</span> terminal.
        Once you have loaded disk images you can click on the
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">RUN</span> button and the output window
        will appear with the H-89 system prompt "H:". From the system prompt you
        can execute several system ROM commands but the primary use will be to
        boot to a disk operating system such as HDOS or CP/M. To do this press
        the "B" key and press ENTER. This will boot from the disk image that is
        loaded into the primary device which is SY0.<br />

        If you are booting from a distribution image of HDOS it may appear that
        the system has hung but in fact it is waiting for you&nbsp;to press
        the&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">SPACEBAR</span> so
        that the operating system can auto-detect your terminal baud rate. After
        you press the&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"
          >SPACEBAR</span
        >
        the boot process will begin.<br />

        To learn more about the HDOS operating system download one of the
        <a href="../../documentation.html" target="_blank">operating manuals</a>
        from this web site. At the HDOS prompt&nbsp;you can type
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CAT</span> to get a catalog of
        files, type in the name of any of the
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">.ABS</span> files to execute
        them and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">MOUNT</span> and
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">DISMOUNT</span> disks. The
        boot drive is always assigned SY0 and the other two drives are SY1 and
        SY2.<br />

        Switch back over to the control panel at anytime to change disk images
        or turn on other features of the emulator. When playing games you will
        want to make sure you turn on the
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">2MHz</span> checkbox so that the system
        runs close to the speed of the real system. By default the button is not
        checked and the emulator runs at full speed.<br />

        &nbsp;Click the RESET button on the control panel to reset the

        ROM. This is the same as pressing SHIFT-RESET on the real computer to
        issue a system reset which will take you back to the system ROM prompt

        There is a <span style="font-weight: bold;">DOOR</span> button next to
        the drive slots (SY0 thru SY2). This simulates opening the drive door on
        a real system. Some of the HDOS utilities would auto-detect when you
        inserted a new disk by waiting for the drive door to open. When you
        close the door it'll read the sector headers and determine if a
        different disk has been inserted. If you run an HDOS utility that says
        something like "Insert destination:" and waits there, it is usually
        waiting for a new image to be inserted. You can then click the
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">DOOR</span> button (it now reads
        CLOSE), load a new disk image, and click the
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">CLOSE</span> button.<br />

        When a drive slot button (SY0 thru SY2) turns yellow, that means the
        image in memory is now dirty (it was written to). Click the yellow drive
        button to save the "in-memory" image to the hard drive. Usually when you
        change some HDOS parameters you'll want to save out a new disk image so
        that the parameters will load the next time you boot.<br />

        The drive density drop down box will determine the capacity of the disk
        for that drive slot. You can choose from 1S/40T (one sided, 40 track
        100KB) all the way up to 2S/80T (two sided, 80 track 400KB). This option
        is only useful when using a version of HDOS or CP/M that supports higher
        capacity drives. In the <a href="H8DBootables.zip">H8D Bootables</a> zip
        file are bootable versions of HDOS and CP/M that support this feature.
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"
          ><span style="font-weight: bold;">IMPORTANT NOTE:</span></span
        ><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> My emulator cannot auto-detect
        how the drives are configured from the booted operating system so you
        need to know this information and setup the drive capacities
        appropriately.<br />

          >HIGH CAPACITY DRIVES USING HDOS</span
        ><br />
        <br />
        For HDOS, boot with either the
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">HDOS_2-0_System_Hsy.h8d</span
        >&nbsp;or the
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">HDOS_3-02_System.h8d</span>
        disk images. HDOS 2.0 supports higher capacity drives using the HUG SY
        (HSY) device driver which is available on HUG disk part #885-1095. For
        your convenience I already installed the HSY device driver in the
        HDOS_2-0_System_Hsy disk image. Drives SY1 and SY2 are configured as
        2S/80T drives for this disk image. HDOS 3.0 supports high capacity
        drives natively so no special device drivers are required.<br />
        <br />
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"
          >HIGH CAPACITY DRIVES USING CP/M</span
        ><br />
        <br />
        Heath CP/M requires the BIOS-80 extension to support high capacity
        drives. The installation of BIOS-80 is rather complicated so I setup a
        version of CP/M 2.2.03 with the extension already installed and saved it
        as
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"
          >CPM_2-2-03_Bios80_Zcpr.h8d</span
        >. It is pre-configured with drive SY0 as a 1S/40T drive and drives SY1
        and SY2 as 2S/80T drives. When you boot with the BIOS-80 disk image make
        sure you change the drive capacity for SY1 and SY2 to be 2S/80T.<br />
        <br />
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"
          >FORMATTING HIGH CAPACITY DISK IMAGES</span
        ><br />
        <br />
        In HDOS you run the
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">INIT</span> program from the
        HSY system disk to format high capacity disk images. Drives SY1 and SY2
        are setup as 2S/80T drives and the
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">INIT</span> program will ask
        if you want to format a double sided disk. If you answer YES it will
        begin the format process for a 400KB disk image. If you answer NO it
        will begin the format process for a 200KB (1S/80T) disk image. When
        using the HSY system disk you can only write to 80 track disk images
        (one or two sided) but you can read both 40 and 80 track images.<br />
        <br />
        In CP/M the FORMAT program does not work in my emulator. To create an
        empty disk image all you have to do is select the capacity for the drive
        you want to "format" (2S/80T for SY1 and SY2) and type "ERA B:*.*" (for
        SY1) or "ERA C:*.*" (for SY2) and answer "Y" to the "ALL" prompt. This
        will create a 400KB image and write out a new directory structure to
        create an empty disk image. That's all you need to do to setup a blank
        disk image in CP/M. In the H8D Bootables zip file you'll find an empty
        disk image that has already been formatted for use with BIOS-80 CP/M. It
        is called
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CPM_2-2-03_2S80T.H8D</span
