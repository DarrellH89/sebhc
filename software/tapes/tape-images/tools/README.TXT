These are the binary images that were on the Heath tapes for the cassette system.
Included are the Benton Harbor Basic, Extended Benton Harbor Basic, TED-8, HASL-8, BUG-8, and the Hangman game. 
These are the binary images that came from the original tapes. When I looked at these images, I noticed that each image was preceeded by a number of bytes of 026 (octal) which I believe was used to get the tape in sync, or wait for the speed to be constant or something like that.
I have also included an OLD program that I wrote called DAP. Both the compiled (EXE) version and the original source code (TBS) are included. Make any changes to the source that pleases you.
This program is called Display-Alter-Print (DAP).
I wrote it because Heath used split octal display, and I did not have a program that would display other than in HEX format. This program will allow you to view, print, or alter bytes in a PC type file. You enter the name of the file to work with. You can enter a ? to display the contents of the HELP file (not related to the microsoft kind, I did this 15 or 20 years ago.)
There is also a dump of the H8ROM and the XCON8ROM. I don't have any idea what the Heath part number was for these ROMS. Like I said, this was close to 15 years ago. 
Hope you find some use for these.
