CP/M to HDOS File Transfer Utility Programs

These program are set up to work under the following configuration:

Physical device numbers used below.
SY0:	40 track, 1 side, standard Heath drive
SY1:	40 track, 2 sides
SY2:	80 track, 2 sides

The programs should work if you have three drives by just SETting your drive 
parameters.  If you have fewer drives, you may need to edit the basic programs 
to use the drive configuration you have.

The following directions are for the configuration listed above.

	In the steps below, <lower case text> is what you type.

My system disk is booted from SY1: physical -- H: Boot1

Initialize a floppy for the data transfer process in SY2: logical (SY0: 
physical).  This will be referred to as the transfer disk below.

Create the CP/M Space by running:
	MBASIC FMTCPM<cr>
	ENTER DRIVE TO BE FORMATTED: <SY2:>
	INSERT DISK TO BE FORMATTED INTO DRIVE SY2: AND PRESS RETURN.
	PLEASE REPLACE DISKETTE IN SY2:
	      <open, replace disk if needed and close drive door>
	VOLUME xxx, MOUNTED ON SY2:
	LABEL: <your disk label>
	FUNCTION COMPLETE.
	ANY MORE DISKS TO BE FORMATTED? <N> <cr>if done or <y> to continue

Repeat the steps for each transfer disk you will be using.

When done, you should have a file on the transfer disk(s):
	Name	Ext	Size
