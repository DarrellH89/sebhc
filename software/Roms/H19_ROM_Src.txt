Les,

I've attached a ZIPped file with several .MAC files in three subdirectories.  Each subdir is a fully independent code set for the H19 ROM.  Each of them can be compiled with MACRO-80.  There is also a MAKE batch file pair (ZEX and COM file) to build the ROM from a single command line entry.

The '00' subdir is the raw disassembler output for the H19 ROM.

The '10' subdir contains my first shot at modifying the code.  If you look at the TERMROM.MAC file, near the beginning, you'll find the ORGH19 equate - if it is set to TRUE, you'll get an exact H19 ROM build.  If you set it to FALSE, you can have several optional code improvements, listed immediately below the H19ROM equate.

The '11' subdir is where I ended up.  I really don't recall anything about it, other than what is shown in the header info.

Feel free to pass it around and let anyone do what they want with any of the files.

Last note...  You can burn a 2732 EPROM for use in the H19, but you'll have to use a daughterboard so you can rearrange a couple of pins.  I forget the details, but it's fairly easy.
