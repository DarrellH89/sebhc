Its primary responsibility is to classify the port address and dispatch the device-specific data handling.</p><p>8250 UART emulation is done completely in the I/O package. Minimal 8251 USART emulation is done, sufficient for PAM/8 to read and write tapes using its load/dump functions.

(None of the other functions of the ORG/0 card are implemented in this emulator.)

The target task is able to determine, based on its own momentary status, whether to return a txEmpty or rxAvailable flag to the 8080 program. This call also makes <i>most</i> incoming character I/O event-driven by the user program, greatly reducing emulation overhead. This feature is described further in <a href="design_serial.html" onMouseOver="self.status='Go to serial i/o'; return true">Serial I/O</a> and <a href="design_tape.html" onMouseOver="self.status='Go to tape i/o'; return true">Tape I/O</a>.</p><p>The (*outDriver) call was a major performance improvement over the earlier, internal-polling method of pulling characters off the 8250 chip. By calling the device's output processing routine, character output becomes entirely event driven by the user program, greatly reducing emulation overhead. However, this also interferes with the use of transmitter-empty interrupts, which should not be used with the emulator.</p><p><a href="#top" onMouseOver="self.status='go to the top of this page'; return true">go to top</a></p><hr><a name="u8250"></a><p><b>8250 Emulation</b></p><p>When the user program INs or OUTs an 8250 port, the port number is reduced to a zero-based index by subtracting the base port address, and in8250 or out8250 are called to handle the operation. Each is discussed below, register by register.</p><p><i>in8250</i></p><dl><dt>Data Register (offset 0)</dt><dd><p>If the divisor latch access bit is not set in the LCR, the last-received data byte is returned. The dataReady bit in the LSR is reset, and if the receipt of this byte was the cause of an interrupt that interrupt condition is cleared. If the loopback bit is set in the MCR, the txEmpty bit is reset as well.</p><p>If the divisor latch access bit is set in the LCR, the low-order byte of the baud rate divisor is returned.</p></dd><dt>Interrupt Enable Register (offset 1)</dt><dd><p>If the divisor latch access bit is not set in the LCR, this simply returns the value of the IER. Otherwise, the high-order byte of the baud rate divisor is returned.</p></dd><dt>Interrupt ID Register (offset 2)</dt><dd><p>Returns the content of the IID register. If there was a transmitter-empty interrupt pending, this is sufficient to clear the interrupt.</p></dd><dt>Line Control Register (offset 3)</dt><dd><p>Simply returns the content of the LCR.</p></dd><dt>Modem Control Register (offset 4)</dt><dd><p>Simply returns the content of the MCR.</p></dd><dt>Line Status Register (offset 5)</dt><dd><p>If there is a (*driverStatus) routine associated with this chip, that routine is called and its results OR'd with any line status bits generated locally. This combined value is returned to the caller.</p><p>If the txEmpty flag has made a transition from 0 to 1, a transmitter empty interrupt is scheduled if enabled. (This is done only when the bit first transitions from 0 to 1. The user program will read the IID, which clears the interrupt. Then if no character is written, this interrupt should not take place again until after the next character written causes that transition.)</p><p>Finally, any error bits are cleared.</p></dd><dt>Modem Status Register (offset 6)</dt><dd><p>The modem status bits and modem status delta bits are returned.

If line status interrupts are enabled, this will cause an interrupt to be scheduled.</p></dd></dl><p><i>Interrupt Handling</i></p><p>Any change in the status of a register that might cause an interrupt condition will cause a call to the interrupt scheduler, which will inspect the registers to set the Interrupt ID register in priority order &#8212; line status, receiver full, transmitter empty, and modem status. If the result of the call is that an interrupt condition is present, <a href="design_h8.html" onMouseOver="self.status='Go to h8 processing'; return true">H8 Processing</a> is called to set the appropriate mask bit.

Which is all that counts, really.</p><p>When a tape input and/or output file is opened or closed, Tape I/O calls the I/O package to record the flags it wants returned on an IN to the 8251 status port (371q). Any IN to that port will get whatever bits were recorded.</p><p>Port 371q is also the 8251 configuration port. Any OUTs to this port are simply ignored; the emulator doesn't need any of the provided configuration information.</p><p>If the receiver ready bit is set in the status byte and there is an IN to the data port (370q), tapeGetByte is called and the provided byte is returned to the caller. Otherwise, a zero is returned.</p><p>If the transmitter empty bit is set in the status byte and there is an OUT to the data port (370q), tapePutByte is called to record the output byte.
