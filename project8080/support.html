<font size="-1">
</font><p><font size="-1"><b>Macintosh Host System Requirements</b></font></p>

<p><font size="-1">There are two major requirements the host Macintosh system needs to meet in order to successfully run the emulator:</font></p>

<ol>
<font size="-1"><li><p>The emulator requires System 8.1 or better. It was developed to the published 8.1 specifications.</p></li>
<li><p>The host Macintosh must be fast enough to host the emulator.
Recent experience shows that if the host is too slow, HDOS will not
boot correctly. Experience suggests that the minimum host system, to
run the emulator at full speed when set to 2 mhz, is on the order of a
7100/66, with an 80 mhz machine recommended.
</p></li></font></ol>

<p><font size="-1">Additional specifications:</font></p>

<ul>
<font size="-1"><li>the initial installation of the emulator will require about 2 megabytes of free disk space;</li>
<li>each additional HDOS diskette you build will require approximately
100-400 K/bytes of free disk space, depending on the diskette format;</li>
<li>the emulator requires 5 megabytes of memory at run time.</li>

<a name="limitations"></a>
<font size="-1">
</font><p><font size="-1"><b>Emulator Limitations</b></font></p>
<p>
<font size="-1">You would think that emulating an ancient, limited
microcomputer on a modern Macintosh would be a walk in the park. Well,
stop thinking that! It ain't true! As it happens, there are a number of
very simple things done by the H8 that are a real pain to get right in
these modern, enlightened times. Here's the short list.
</font></p><p>
<font size="-1"><i>Time</i>
</font></p><p>
<font size="-1">I have made no attempt whatsoever to execute an 8080A
instruction in the same amount of time that a real 8080A would execute
the same instruction. I would expect a wide variation in instruction
execution times based on the speed of the host machine, the compiler
used, the compiler optimization options selected, and a host of other
smaller factors.
</font></p><p><font size="-1">The emulator now paces in machine cycles
instead of instruction counts, so the speed of the emulator, when set
to 2 mhz, is the same as a real H8, <i>when measured over a fairly long period of time</i>
(several milliseconds). Short sequences of instructions will still run
in whatever time is required, as noted in the first paragraph of this
section. (ref: <a href="design_perf.html" onmouseover="self.status='Go to performance'; return true">Performance</a>)</font></p>
<p>
<font size="-1">What does this mean to user code? Anyone who has
implemented real-time processes that count on "delay loops" to give
them a very small, specific bit of delay, are not going to be happy
with the results on this emulator. The only stable source of delay
information will be to interrogate the system tick counter.
</font></p><p>
<font size="-1">Also, when you drag a window or browse a menu bar in a
Mac application, the application will get no processor time at all. The
only way to maintain a proper emulation environment is to define this
time out of the H8 universe. When the user is browsing the menu system,
time stops as far as the H8 is concerned.
You can read more about this in the <a href="design_time.html" onmouseover="self.status='Go to time'; return true">time</a> design note.
</font></p><p><font size="-1">Finally, you should be aware that the
clock on a real H8 ticks 512 times per second, while the emulator ticks
at a rate of 500 times per second. While it's possible to match the H8
exactly in this regard, it was deemed to be a more straight-forward
approach to use one basic time source, and I needed a 1ms interval
practically everywhere. With all the other time-oriented compromises
and inaccuracies, this one seemed minor.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1"><i>8250 UART Emulation</i></font></p>

<p><font size="-1">8250 UART emulation supports transmitter-empty
interrupts, but they should not be used with the emulator. Output
characters are driven to the output device immediately upon receipt,
clearing the transmitter. If transmitter-empty interrupts were used to
send messages out a port, the emulator would not exit interrupt service
until the entire message were transmitted. This defeats the performance
improvements that you should get from the use of transmitter-empty
interrupts.</font></p>

<p>
<font size="-1"><i>Terminal</i>
</font></p><p><font size="-1">The emulator provides complete functional
emulation of the H-19 terminal using Heathkit-mode escape sequences.
There are a few differences from a real H-19:</font></p>

<ul>
<font size="-1"><li>ANSI-mode escape sequences are not supported;</li>
<li>keyboard keys are, by necessity, laid out for the Macintosh keyboard, not the H-19 keyboard;</li>
<li>the terminal modes "key click on" and "key click off" are not
supported; the escape sequences can be used but will have no effect;</li>
<li>the terminal mode "keyboard disabled" is not supported; the escape sequence can be used but will have no effect;</li>
<li>baud rates are not supported, nor are they needed in the emulator; the escape sequence can be used but will have no effect;</li>
<li>control-function key will not cause the function key to be acted upon locally, as it is in a real H-19;</li>
<li>a scroll-back buffer and copy/paste support have been added as user convenience items;</li>
<li>in keeping with modern sensibilities, the terminal uses black text on a white screen; reverse video is white on black.</li>
</font></ul>

<p>
<font size="-1"><i>Sound</i>
</font></p><p>
<font size="-1">The H8's sound mechanism is crude at best. A bit in a
PAM8 control register output is ANDed with a 1000Hz square-wave
(produced by dividing the 2.048 MHz bus clock signal by 2048) and the
result is sent to the speaker. This is effectively a timed burst of a
1000Hz tone. The key click is a four-cycle burst of tone, which your
ear will perceive as a click. (Hardware information provided by <a href="resources.html#credits" onmouseover="self.status='Go to credits'; return true">Dave Wallace</a>.)
</font></p><p>
<font size="-1">On a modern Macintosh, we can't even come close to that level of crudity.
</font></p><p>
<font size="-1">The limitations on any existing H8 software are that
the attempts we all made to generate "music" using the internal speaker
on the H8 by changing the frequency of the clicks, will absolutely not
work here. If you've come to this emulator in the desperate hope of
once again hearing an H8 squeak out "Mary Had a Little Lamb," I'm sorry
to disappoint.
</font></p><p>
<font size="-1"><i>Keypad</i>
</font></p><p>
<font size="-1">Eight of the front-panel keys return their value in the
high-order four bits of the input port, and the other eight use the
low-order four bits. This makes various two-key combinations possible.
PAM8 uses two such combinations for its RTM/0 and RST/0 functions.
Others were available to applications that chose to use them.
</font></p><p>
<font size="-1">Since we have only one mouse, we can't support any
two-key combinations at all. RTM/0 and RST/0 can be invoked by holding
down the option key while clicking the # and / keys, respectively.
</font></p><p>
<font size="-1">Any existing program that uses two-key combinations
will either have to be modified, or the emulator modified to support
other two-key combinations using modifier keys.

<p><b>Release Notes</b></p>

<p><i>Release 5.3.3a</i></p>
<p>To quote an old friend, coworker and Unix/Xenix programmer, Pin Lim, under similar circumstances: "Sometimes life is hard."</p>
<p>Mac OS has some interesting rules in how it selects an ICON for
plotting in a window. The programmer can select the resource number but
cannot select the color; you throw a whole suite of ICON resources at
the system and let it take whichever one it likes.</p>
<p>In release 5.3.2, I changed to color icons for the hold mode,
holding, and insert H-19 indicators, and they worked fine, but I
violated a rule. In release 5.3.3, I changed something <i>totally unrelated to those icons</i> and now they don't show up at all. Sheesh.</p>
<p>Release 5.3.3a fixes this etiquette violation by <b>adding black and white versions</b> of the icons to the resource fork, and now we have <b>color</b> icons back on screen. Go figure.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: This release is coded internally as release 5.3.3. It's only called 5.3.3a in this archive.</p>

<p><i>Release 5.3.3</i></p>
<p>Added a configuration option to load either the original PAM/8 ROM
or the PAM/GO ROM when the system is started or reset. Both ROMs are
included with the package. See the <a href="pgs/menus.html#emupref" target="_blank">emulator preferences</a> section of the help system for details.</p>

<p><i>Release 5.3.2</i></p>
<p>Added file creator and printer margin preferences, and made most
preferences (all but system speed) take effect immediately. Also
cleaned up the H-17 mount preferences dialog somewhat.</p>
<p>Added select / copy / paste to the H-19. You can select text in
various ways to copy to the clipboard, and paste text from the
clipboard into the H8 as if that text were being typed at the keyboard.</p>
<p>Scrolling using the scroll-bar slider is now live; the screen content moves as you move the slider.</p>
<p>A small number of other minor user interface tweeks are included, such as color icons for the on-screen indicators.</p>
<p>Details can be found in the <a href="http://members.aol.com/heath8080a/h8_toc.html" target="_blank">help system</a>.</p>

<p><i>Release 5.3.1</i></p>
<p>Corrected a problem with H-19 buffer save &#8212; the file would be empty if the first line of the buffer was non-blank.</p>
<p>Added three usability features to the scroll-back buffer:</p>
<ul>
<li>if line 25 is enabled when the buffer is saved, line 25 is saved;</li>
<li>the command-home key sequence will move to the first non-blank line in the scroll-back buffer;</li>
<li>the command-option-clear key sequence will, upon user confirmation,
clear the scroll-back buffer as well as the H-19 screen (the
command-clear key sequence is unmodified).</li>
</ul>
<p>Internally, the screen-scrolling code was cleaned up considerably in
preparation to adding text selection to support copy/paste. In
particular, the control plane is now combined with the screen text.</p>
<p><a href="#top" onmouseover="self.status='go to the top of this page'; return true">go to top</a></p>

<p><i>Release 5.3</i></p>
<p>Added a 476-line scroll-back buffer to the <a href="design_h19.html#keyboard">H-19</a>, with the ability to save both the buffer and the active screen (500 lines, total) to a Macintosh text file.</p>
<p>Added an optional comment, ";check: nnn", to the <a href="design_h17.html#struct">portable disk format</a>.
The emulator adds this comment when creating a portable disk, and if it
is present when a disk is loaded, compares nnn with the calculated
sector body check byte. If the values don't match, the disk is not
mounted.</p>
<p>The <a href="release.html#util">Disk Dumper</a> program was also modified to add this comment to the disk image, ensuring the user that the dumped image is sound.</p>
<p>Thanks to Stanley Webb for suggesting the checksum feature. It's a
real improvement to the reliability of the disk image transfer process.</p>
<p><a href="#top" onmouseover="self.status='go to the top of this page'; return true">go to top</a></p>

<p><i>Release 5.2.1</i></p>
<p>Minor tweaking.</p>
<p>Added error dialogs for three malformed disk header problems that were previously "silent" disk insertion failures.</p>
<p>Added interesting operations statistics to the About window (see <a href="gfx/stats.gif" target="_blank">sample</a>), at the cost of a slight reduction in Turbo-mode performance.</p>
<p>In the H-17 Management dialog, moved the volume number to the same line as the disk label.</p>
<p>Added help sections on Boot.abs, low-level H-17 driver calls, and
8050 UART programming and cleaned up various errors in other sections
in my ongoing efforts to get it right.</p>
<p><a href="#top" onmouseover="self.status='go to the top of this page'; return true">go to top</a></p>

<p><i>Release 5.2</i></p>
<p>Added features to the printer:</p>
<ul>
<li>support for <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, and <u>underlined</u> text;</li>
<li>ability to change the <font face="courier">font face</font> and <font size="+1">size</font>;</li>
<li>ability to change the font color using the <font color="#ff0000">red</font>/<font color="#00ff00">green</font>/<font color="#0000ff">blue</font> color specification system;</li>
<li>support for Heath H-19 graphics.</li>
</ul>
<p>The LP: driver was updated to support these features &#8212; it needed to pass the ESC character to the emulator. <b>Make sure to install the new LP: driver</b> found on each of the disks included in the distribution package.</p>
<p>Fixed a minor bug in H-19 that caused the occasional character
written to the right-most couple of columns to be written on the H8
front panel instead of the H-19 window. Yeesh.</p>

<p><i>Known Problems in v5.2</i></p>
<p>An old "bug" has returned: on occasion the Apple menu won't show
cascading menus immediately after the emulator is started, but will
after the About window, the H-17 window, or either of the settings
dialogs are opened. This seems to be due to an undocumented timing
issue in the initialization of the appearance manager.</p>
<p>Work around: open/close the About window and cascading menus should appear.</p>
<p><a href="#top" onmouseover="self.status='go to the top of this page'; return true">go to top</a></p>

<p><i>Release 5.1.1</i></p>

<p>Added disk volume numbers and labels to the H-17 Manage window and
corrected a small problem with control initiation when inserting a disk
with the finder while the H-17 Manage window is open.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="resources.html#credits" onmouseover="self.status='go to credits'; return true">Stanley Webb</a> for the suggestion and for providing background on label content and the pitfalls of formatting them.</p>

<p><i>Release 5.1</i></p>

<p>This is a Power PC-only release. The 68K version is frozen at 4.1.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Changed the pacing mechanism to work in machine cycles instead
of instruction counts so that the emulator will better emulate the
actual speed of an H8 when the system speed is set to 2 mhz. Refer to <a href="#limitations" onmouseover="self.status='Go to limitations'; return true">limitations</a> for a caution on this feature.</p></li>
<li><p>Added 4 and 8 mhz speeds so that users of faster Mac's can speed
things up a bit without totally ruining the emulation experience. Turbo
mode, which runs unpaced, is still supported.</p></li>
<li><p>Added system speed and H-19 cursor preferences which can be set from a new preferences dialog found on the Edit menu.</p></li>
<li><p>Added a "remember window position" preference which can be set from a new item on the Window menu.</p></li>
<li><p>Changed the H-17 Management window from a dialog box to a normal
application window. The emulator will continue to run with this window
open, whether it's the front window or a back window. The emulator will
also continue to run under the About window.</p></li>
<li><p>Added and rearranged a number of elements of the user interface
&#8212; close boxes on the windows, a new Hide Window item on the file menu,
a new Speed menu, etc. Refer to Menu help when you launch the emulator.</p></li>
<li><p>Added a Hold Screen Mode indicator different from the "holding"
on-screen indicator, to let you know that you are in hold-screen mode
when you are not actually holding for the scroll key. (Thanks to <a href="resources.html#credits" onmouseover="self.status='Go to resources'; return true">Stanley Webb</a> for that suggestion.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There were some internal changes as well, not really visible to the user. Refer to the <a href="design.html" onmouseover="self.status='Go to design'; return true">Design</a> section of this web site for details.</p>

<p><i>Release 4.2.6 and 4.1.6</i></p>

<p>This release fixes the bug documented in the 3-August bug report below.</p>
<p>Release 4.1 is <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">frozen</span> as of this release. I will fix any ugly bugs that might be uncovered, but this is it for the 68K release.</p>

<p><b>3-August-2002 bug report</b></p>
<p>Thanks again to <a href="resources.html#credits" onmouseover="self.status='go to credits'; return true">Stanley Webb</a>
for pointing this out to me. If you create a text file on the Macintosh
that does not have a carriage return as the last character in the file,
and transfer that file to the H8 via the AT: driver, the last line of
the file will be improperly terminated with a carriage return character
instead of a new line character.</p>
<p>This is the result of an incomplete fix way back in release 2.3,
where native Mac printing was first introduced. I changed the AT:
driver, moved CR-to-NL translation to the Mac side of the interface,
and missed <em>one crumby character</em> in serialio.c. Rats.</p>
<p>This will be fixed in the 4.x.6 release. In the mean time, make sure
that all Mac-originated text files have a CR at the end of the last
line &#8212; e.g., press return after the last line of text &#8212; before
transferring the file to the H8.</p>

<p><i>Release 4.2.5 and 4.1.5</i></p>

<p>This release fixes a coding error that caused a type 1 or type 3
program crash under OS 8.1. This error was introduced way back in
release 2.2.</p>

<p><i>Release 4.2.4 and 4.1.4</i></p>

<p>This release fixes a design error that had the H-19 terminal
responding to flow control (Xon/Xoff) characters transmitted by the H8.
A real H-19 does not respond to flow control received on the serial
interface.</p>

<p><i>Release 4.2.3 and 4.1.3</i></p>

<p>This release fixes the bug described in the June 12 bug notice below.</p>

<p>Implementation note:</p>
<p>If:</p>
	<ol>
	<li><p>the H8 emulator is the front application; and</p></li>
	<li><p>the H-19 window is the front window;</p></li>
	</ol>
<p>...then the H-19 window will scroll quickly without creating update regions and updating the whole window after each scroll.</p>
<p>If either of these conditions is <b>not</b> true, then an update
region is created for every type of scroll (scroll up on line feed,
scroll down on RVI, insert/delete line, insert/delete character) and
the window is updated after each instance of a scroll. This correctly
displays the window when there is an overlapping window, though there
is a performance penalty.</p>

<p><i>Bug Notice &#8212; 12-June-2002</i></p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="resources.html#credits" onmouseover="self.status='go to credits'; return true">Neal Granroth</a> for pointing this out to me.</p>
<p>If you allow another window to overlay the H-19 window while an H8
application is writing to the H-19, the H-19 will not scroll properly.
The area immediately above the overlaid window will contain apparent
garbage.</p>
<p>This is the unintended consequence of a performance improvement I
made to window scrolling back in the 3.1 release, as I recall. The H-19
is simply scrolled without creating and invalidating an update region,
avoiding the inevitable total-window redraw on every scroll.</p>
<p>I'm not sure yet exactly how I'm going to fix it, but I will fix it. Stay tuned.</p>
<p>In the mean time, either (a) don't let another window overlap the
H-19 window while it's active, or (b) simply hide/show the H-19 window
to clean up the display.</p>

<p><i>Release 4.2.2 and 4.1.2</i></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed a bug in the H19 emulator. With the cursor on line 25,
sending a home sequence (Esc HCUH) would move the cursor to line 25
column 1. Turns out a real H19 would move it to line 1 column 1. Thanks
to <a href="resources.html#credits" onmouseover="self.status='go to credits'; return true">Neal Granroth</a> for pointing that out to me.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top" onmouseover="self.status='go to the top of this page'; return true">go to top</a></p>

<p><i>Release 4.2.1</i></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed a bug that caused the enter key on the H-19 numeric keypad to transmit the wrong value when in normal or shifted mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Added a new Programming Information section to the Help system.
New pages there include a Memory Map, full Basic documentation,
Assembly Language documentation and HDOS System Calls. (The Help
package was also updated in the 4.1 release package.)</p></li>
<li><p>I updated the standard .ACM files on the Extras disk to include
all the information in the Memory Map help page and the HDOS System
Calls page. (The Extras disk was also updated in the 4.1 release
package.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top" onmouseover="self.status='go to the top of this page'; return true">go to top</a></p>

<p><i>Release 4.2</i></p>

<p>There are none! All I did was port the source code to Apple's MPW
development environment &#8212; a non-trivial change &#8212; so I could compile and
link as a native PPC application.</p>

<p>While I was in there, I changed a few error messages slightly, and cleaned up the fonts in the About box.</p>

<p><b>Notice &#8212; 9-Feb-2002</b></p>

<p>The Enter key on the numeric keypad doesn't work correctly in the
4.2 release. This problem is not present in 4.1. It only affects normal
and shifted mode; alternate mode Enter works fine.</p>

<p>I ported the source to MPW to produce release 4.2. MPW's MrC
compiler "flips" the meaning of \n and \r. I have some \r's in the H-19
emulator keyboard translation tables, and they're translating as line
feeds instead of carriage returns. HDOS weeds out line feeds, so it
appears that the key does nothing.</p>

<p>I'll have a fix in 4.2.1 in a week or so, just as soon as I finish a
help system update. In the mean time, use the Return key on the main
keyboard instead of the Enter key on the keypad.</p>

<p><a href="#top" onmouseover="self.status='go to the top of this page'; return true">go to top</a></p>

<p><i>Release 4.1</i></p>

<ul>
<li><p>A number of performance improvements were made to allow the
emulator to run on slower machines. We got something of a 30% or better
increase in raw CPU throughput on the author's machine under Turbo mode.</p></li>
<li><p>The performance improvements actually made the emulator so fast
as to be nearly unusable on the author's machine when run under Turbo
mode, so I added H-19 terminal output pacing. The terminal will now
display a maximum of 2,000 characters per second, no matter how fast
the host system runs. Turbo mode now only speeds the processor, as it
was supposed to do in the first place.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug in I/O Processing that was preventing a received
break from causing an interrupt when line status interrupts were
enabled.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a coding problem in the system scheduling loop; we were
repeatedly inserting the same time record in the system time queue over
and over. It is now inserted once, removed once, and primed very, very
often.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><b>12-Jan-2002</b> &#8212; Init.abs will not work at very high processor
speeds. It appears to "hang" with interrupts disabled. If this happens
to you, switch off Turbo Mode and the initialization will continue and
complete successfully.</p>

<p>This is a speed sensitivity in init.abs. The problem cannot be corrected in the emulator.</p>

<p><a href="#top" onmouseover="self.status='go to the top of this page'; return true">go to top</a></p>

<p><i>Release 4.0</i></p>

<ul>
<li><p>H8 software can now access and use the Macintosh modem.</p></li>
<li><p>The emulator now supports double-sided and 80-track disks when the HUG Enhanced SY: Driver is installed. (<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">The driver is available on the release page.</span>)</p></li>
<li><p>The emulator now supports a "Turbo Mode" which effectively
disables processor pacing and allows the 8080A to run at the fastest
speed possible on the host Macintosh system. There are some cautions to
the use of Turbo Mode; please make sure you read the documentation in
the Help system.</p></li>
<li><p>A "Reset" button was added to the Manage Diskettes dialog,
allowing for the natural use of the "reset" HDOS command and easing the
swapping of diskettes on a disk drive.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top" onmouseover="self.status='go to the top of this page'; return true">go to top</a></p>


<p><i>Release 3.1</i></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Some changes were made to the operation of the "extra" keys on
the Mac keyboard &#8212; the cursor keys, del, and home &#8212; to make them
function more logically when the H-19 keypad is in Alternate Keypad
mode. This is best described in the Help system, on the H-19
Programming Information page.</p></li>
<li><p>An 8080A Processor Technical Documentation page was added to the
help system. This contains details on the system flags, a version of
the octal reference chart, and a terse but complete description of all
opcodes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The keyboard changes appear small, but are significant when you
start using an application that uses Alternate Keypad mode, such as the
PIE text editor. Believe me!</p>
<p><a href="#top" onmouseover="self.status='go to the top of this page'; return true">go to top</a></p>

<p><i>Release 3.0</i></p>

<ul>
<li><p>H-19 Video Terminal emulation is now supported. Please review the help files for information on using the H-19 window.</p></li>
<li><p>The sound played after entry of the 3rd PAM/8 digit has been changed to something more appropriate.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top" onmouseover="self.status='go to the top of this page'; return true">go to top</a></p>

<p><i>Release 2.3</i></p>

<ul>

<li><p>You can now print directly to the Mac printer. A new LP: driver
has been released to work with this new emulator feature. See the <a href="design_serial.html#prdesign" onmouseover="self.status='Go to design note'; return true">Print Handler Design</a> and <a href="design_serial.html#prlayout" onmouseover="self.status='Go to design note'; return true">Print Page Layout</a> design notes for some details.</p>
<p>One key improvement is that print functionality is automatic with
this release; you no longer have to open a print file before printing.</p></li>

<li><p>Text file transfer between the H8 and Mac environments is now
automatic; you no longer have to remember to open files in advance. A
new AT: driver has been released to work with this new emulator feature.</p></li>

<li><p>The emulator now requires five (5) megabytes of system memory to
run. The extra ram was allocated to make sure that the Macintosh print
package had sufficient space to do its thing.</p></li>

<li><p>I've removed the HTML-based source documentation from the source
package as it's hard to maintain and of dubious value, anyway. I'm
going to better comment the source for the next release, which should
eliminate the need for the separate package.</p></li>

</ul>
<p><a href="#top" onmouseover="self.status='go to the top of this page'; return true">go to top</a></p>

<p><i>Release 2.2</i></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Added preferences. You can now choose which disk, if any, is
automatically inserted in a drive when the emulator is started. Refer
to the <a href="design_h17.html#pref">Preferences</a> design note for details.</p></li>
<li><p>You can now open a PAM/8 tape file or insert a diskette by opening the file with the Finder.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top" onmouseover="self.status='go to the top of this page'; return true">go to top</a></p>

<p><i>Release 2.1</i></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Added background operation. When the H8 is not the front
application, it will run for 10ms between calls to WaitNextEvent. It
will also update the front panel LEDs every 10ms. When the H8 is the
front application, it will make these calls every 30ms, which is an
increase from the previous version.</p></li>
<li><p>Added 'TEXT' and 'hfdr' resources to provide a description to the Apple System Profiler application.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed the duration of PAM/8's tones under System 9.1. The "boop"
that occurs after the entry of the 3rd digit is still too long, but
it's as short as I can get it until I can get a fix from Apple.</p></li>
<li><p>Increased the H-19's character-gathering time window from 1ms to
5ms to reduce overhead and boost performance. Terminal performance
increased by approx. 50% on the author's system.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed the mount problem with uninitialized disks. You can now
create and dismount a disk without initializing it. The next time you
mount it, HDOS will still consider the disk to be uninitialized.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed the problem that was causing the last line to apparently
be lost when transferring text from the Mac to the H8. If a text file
does not end in Carriage Return, one will be appended before we return
EOF to the AT: driver.</p></li>
<li><p>Updated and reformatted the user help system. It's much more
attractive now and easier to use. And it includes two new sections:
Release Notes and Error Messages.</p></li>
