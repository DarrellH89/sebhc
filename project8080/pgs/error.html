                        The Appearance Manager, part of System 8.5 and up, is required in order for the H8 emulator to operate. Install or enable the Appearance Manager, make sure that platinum appearance is enabled, and try again.

                        The checksum in the portable-format disk image you are trying to load, does not match the checksum calculated based on the data in the sector itself. Recreate the image or use a backup image.

                    <p>
                        If you absolutely must mount this image, use a text editor to change all instances of the string ";check:" to something like ";nocheck:". This will bypass the checksum comparison and if all else is well the disk will mount. However, the data may well
                        be corrupted. Use this disk image with extreme caution.

                        The file being loaded appears to be a diskette file from reading its header, but the emulator ran out of file before the structure was completely loaded. Possible problems: The file was damaged, incorrectly saved, or the header was incorrectly modified
                        after being saved (e.g., the header says to expect 800 sectors to follow but there are only 400 sectors following).

                        However, you should note that the emulator allocates a file buffer large enough to read the whole file for input. If you try to pass a huge file to the emulator, you can cause this problem. But then again, you really shouldn't try to read a file larger
                        than an H8 disk.

                        You might try stopping and restarting the emulator. If it persists, allocate another megabyte of memory to the emulator.

                        You probably tried to mount a 'TEXT' file to a drive, and the 'TEXT' file didn't not contain the proper header identifying it as an H-17 disk.
