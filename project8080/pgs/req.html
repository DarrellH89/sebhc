            <b>H8 Emulator Hosting Requirements</b>
        </font>

        <font face="Geneva,Arial" size="2" color="black">
            <p>
                The emulator requires Macintosh OS Release 8.1 or better. Version 5 was developed using Apple's MPW version 3.6a1.
            </p>

            <p>
                A Power Macintosh is required.
            </p>

            <p>
                A color monitor is required.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Appearance Manager is required; the emulator will not start if it is not present.
            </p>

            <p>
                The emulator is a relatively small application that requires only about 2 megabytes of disk space, as initially distributed, and 5 megabytes of memory at run time.
            </p>
        </font>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <font size="3" face="Verdana,Geneva" color="0000FF">
            <b>Performance</b>
        </font>
    </p>

    <ul>
        <font face="Geneva,Arial" size="2" color="black">
            <p>
                The author runs the emulator on a 300mhz G3 desktop system. Performance is supurb.
            </p>

            <p>
                User testing suggests that a 7100/66 is about the minimum required to get a good emulation experience at an emulated 2mhz clock speed. Any Mac faster than that should work fine.
            </p>

            <p>
                As host system speed increases, you will see more benefit from the faster clock speeds available on the emulator (ref:
                <a href="menus.html">Emulator Menus</a>). Please refer to the Design section of the project web site for details.
            </p>
